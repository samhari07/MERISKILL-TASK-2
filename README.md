# MERISKILL-TASK-2
# Title of the project 2: “Diabetes Patients”
 
About Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2
From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

# key insights

Diabetes Prevalence: The dataset includes both diabetic (Outcome=1) and non-diabetic (Outcome=0) patients. You can calculate the percentage of patients with diabetes to understand the prevalence of the disease in this specific population.

Age and Diabetes Risk: Analyze the relationship between age and diabetes. You may find that older individuals are more likely to have diabetes, which is a common risk factor for the disease.

BMI and Diabetes: Explore the correlation between BMI (Body Mass Index) and diabetes. Higher BMI values may indicate an increased risk of diabetes, as obesity is a known risk factor.

Glucose Levels: Investigate the distribution of glucose levels among diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Elevated glucose levels are a key diagnostic indicator for diabetes.

Blood Pressure and Diabetes: Examine how blood pressure relates to diabetes. High blood pressure can be both a cause and a consequence of diabetes.

Pregnancies and Diabetes: Analyze the relationship between the number of pregnancies and diabetes. It's known that gestational diabetes can occur during pregnancy and may affect long-term diabetes risk.

Insulin Levels: Investigate the distribution of insulin levels in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. High insulin levels might suggest insulin resistance, a characteristic of Type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes Pedigree Function: Understand how the diabetes pedigree function (a measure of diabetes heredity) varies among patients with and without diabetes.

# Inferences:

Age and Diabetes Risk: Older patients in this dataset are more likely to have diabetes. This suggests that age is a significant risk factor for diabetes in this population.

BMI and Diabetes Risk: Higher BMI values are associated with a greater likelihood of diabetes, implying that obesity plays a crucial role in diabetes risk among Pima Indian women.

Glucose Levels and Diagnosis: Elevated glucose levels are a strong indicator of diabetes diagnosis, aligning with diagnostic criteria.

Family History: Patients with a family history of diabetes, as indicated by the pedigree function, may be more susceptible to the disease.

Insulin Levels: Some patients with high insulin levels have diabetes, possibly indicating insulin resistance as a factor.
